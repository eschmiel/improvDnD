# Factions

**The Gold Dragons** are a notorious band of mercenaries that have taken over the town and claiming to be the militia. They claim they were appointed by **The Mayor of Shinefin, Theladon Tommers** but they are extorting him. **Theladon** was actually taking advantage of ships stopping at the port by overcharging them for their docking taxes and taking a cut off
the top for himself. When he pulled this on **The Gold Dragons**, they decided to take over his operation and use his ledgerbook to blackmail him.

If they report him to the Crown, he will be arrested, have his property confiscated by The Realm, and lose his position as mayor. **The Gold Dragons** are known thugs and already have
a reputation with the realm for shirking the laws of the land. They are sometimes hired by the Crown to handle dirty work they don't want to be associated with or to supplement The Realm's forces in battle so they have some leeway as an independent, armed force.

**The State of Landerell** - Ruled by King Lome, they are known to make use of the Gold Dragons for their wet work and are lenient on them. They will come down hard on the mayor for his corruption.

 # Encounters

 ## 1. Intro

The party is in a wagon caravan on the way to the town of **Shinefin**. The cobbler **Maurice Lerndon** is in the wagon with them.

- He asks the party why they're going to **Shinefin** and why they're travelling together. 
- He asks each party member about themselves as a way for the players to introduce themselves.

## 2. The Town Gate

**The Gold Dragons** hold up the caravan and demand 5 gold pieces from each person entering the town (an exorbitant price). 
They demand 10% of the value of all cargo entering the town. The caravan leader **Buck Bimberton** refuses to pay and his wagons are stuck outside the town gate.

- **Maurice** is shocked. He's never heard of them and never had to pay a toll to enter his own home before. He demands to see some credentials and they all have official badges.

## 3. The First Day in Shinefin

- What do the players do when they finally arrive to town? Could be based on their goals for coming to Shinefin or just what kind of person their character is.

Some possibilities:

- Go shopping
-- Magic
-- General store
-- Blacksmith
- Go to the tavern
-- The tavern at the Inn for travellers
-- The tavern on the docks for sailors and dock workers.
- Look for adventuring work
-- The Adventurer's Guild
It's abandoned. Adventurers haven't been through here in a long time. There's some old outdated flyers for people looking to hire adventurers.
- Town Hall
- The Police Station
- The Mayor's Mansion

### The players stumble across some Gold Dragons harrassing the town folks

- Two gold dragons demand that they don't have to pay their bar tab at the tavern.
- Two gold dragons try to extort a shopkeeper for protection money.

## 4. The Next Day: Either/Or

### If the party confronted some of the Gold Dragons

A Gold Dragon officer shows up with an arrest warrant for the party. If they acquiece, they will be put through a sham trial and executed.

### Maurice asks the party to do something about The Gold Dragons

The Gold Dragons robbed half of Buck Bimperton's cargo in the middle of the night. They left him with a massive gash across his chest during the attack.

He's resting at Maurice's house. Maurice wants to take the party to his house to see **Buck** and together they try to hire the party to get rid of **The Gold Dragons** in town.

## 5. Confronting the Captain of The Gold Dragons

- The mayor doesn't want their help despite being terribly abused. The Captain hints at the mayor's impropriety and claims to be legitimate and has the mayor give his blessing.
